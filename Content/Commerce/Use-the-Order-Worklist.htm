        <h1>Using the Order Worklist<MadCap:concept term="Commerce" /></h1>
        <p>Stores, suppliers/warehouses use this screen to view all open orders assigned to them for fulfillment. It shows items assigned to a supplier and in one of the configured order statuses on the <b><MadCap:popup><MadCap:popupHead>Manage Status Types</MadCap:popupHead><MadCap:popupBody>OrderStatus.aspx</MadCap:popupBody></MadCap:popup></b> screen so that store associates can view and pick orders as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>In this screen, stores and warehouses can view all open orders assigned to them for fulfillment. The screen shows orders/items matching statuses configured in <b>Commerce</b> &gt; <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Manage Status Types</b>, then evaluates Pickup, Shipping, and Transfer filters. All orders matching the statuses selected in the filter are displayed at the shipping address level on the screen.</p>
        <p>Suppliers can access this screen from <b>Supplier</b> &gt; <b>Supplier Shipping</b> &gt; <b>Order Worklist</b>. Because the functionality is based upon supplier permissions, the supplier view is limited when viewing the details of an order.</p>
        <div class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;"><span class="note">(for Suppliers):</span> When viewing this screen, only those orders containing items assigned to the logged in supplier are shown. If the supplier prints a pick-list from this screen, it will only contain items in the selected orders assigned to the logged in supplier. Suppliers can see only the <b>View Order</b> tab, the <b>Update Item Status</b> tab, and the <b>Ship Order</b> tab, and these will contain only  items assigned to the logged in supplier. Suppliers are not able to view the <b>Edit Order</b>, <b>Process Payment</b>, <b>Credit Order</b>, or <b>Send PO</b> tabs.</div>
        <p>Information provided at the top of the screen includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Total Unshipped Orders</b>—a count of all orders assigned to the supplier in statuses matching the statuses selected in the filters.</li>
            <li><b>Total Orders Today</b>—all orders assigned to a supplier that were created today and in statuses matching the statuses selected in the filters.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The <b>Exp.</b> column denotes expedited orders.<br /></div>
