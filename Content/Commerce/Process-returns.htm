        <h1>Processing returns<MadCap:concept term="Commerce" /></h1>
        <p>After returns are processed using <MadCap:popup><MadCap:popupHead>RMA</MadCap:popupHead><MadCap:popupBody>return merchandise authorization </MadCap:popupBody></MadCap:popup> requests, they appear on the <b>Returns</b> page. You can also process returns without RMAs and view orders from this page. This keeps a record of the items customers have sent back.</p>
        <p>You can view all orders and RMAs on the <b>Returns</b> page.</p>
        <h2>Allowing for returns on your site</h2>
        <p>By default, all products on your site are returnable. However, there are several settings you must enable to allow for processing of returns and creation of RMAs. After these settings are enabled, you can customize how you want to process returns.</p>
        <div class="note"><b>Warning:</b> Make certain your site is set up to create RMAs and process returns before continuing. Returns and RMAs must be configured properly before they can be used on your site. Refer to knowledge base article #2201, <i>Setting up Your Site to Process RMAs and Returns</i>.</div>
        <h2>Managing returns</h2>
        <h3>Filter and search for orders</h3>
        <p>You can filter and search for orders by order number, text, and/or date range. When searching for returns by order numbers that do not have a previous RMA associated with them, the order appears regardless of the date range, making it easy to find the order. You can also search by external order number. This order number is the unique number assigned to the order when the order is created outside of the OMS.</p>
        <p>You can also filter and search by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Date Type</b>: Whether it be an RMA date or an order date, you can filter by date type.</li>
            <li><b>Return Reason</b>: You can filter by return reasons, if needed. These return reasons (types) are configured at CRM &gt; Communications &gt; Listings. In addition, the Aptos platform allows you to control which return reasons are applicable to online RMA generation. See <a href="../Customers/Listings.htm">Managing listings</a> to learn more about return types.</li>
            <li><b>Sort by</b>: There are also filters for various sort options in this list menu such as: order number, order date, contact name, order total and salesperson.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>You can process returns on this page in one of two ways.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Orders without Existing RMAs - When a customer returns merchandise to you without first obtaining an RMA, you can start and complete the return process here.</li>
            <li>Items with Existing RMA - Items for which an RMA has been created, are displayed in this panel. RMAs are created at <b>Commerce</b> &gt; <b>Orders</b> &gt; <b>Manage</b>.</li>

        <h2>Crediting orders</h2>
        <p>After you select items for return, and saved, <MadCap:variable name="DC.EOM short" />automatically looks for three fields for each returned item, and opens and pre-populate the <b>Credit Order</b> window with those amounts. These fields are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>returnable credit amount (located in the credit column)</li>
            <li>Shipping Credit</li>
            <li>Tax Credit</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These fields are populated via the 'ConfirmShippedOrder' API method located at: https://api.Aptos.com/wiki/Order ConfirmShippedOrder.aspx.</p>
        <p>After processing the credit for the return, <MadCap:variable name="DC.EOM short" />places the "return reason" selected in the <b>Reason for Credit</b> field and ignores the value from the "Credit Reason" selection if your site uses the GetOrderCredits API call to get the actual return reason when a credit is applied.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/returns5.jpg" style="mc-thumbnail: hover;mc-thumbnail-max-width: 550px;" />
        </p>
        <p>If the items being returned have not had a returnable credit amount specified, a message is displayed at the top of the Credit Order window stating,</p>
        <div class="quotation">The items being returned have not had a returnable credit amount specified and the credit cannot be applied automatically. Please manually apply a detailed level credit/refund.</div>
        <p>This means that the credit cannot be applied automatically because the 'returnable credit field' has not been populated. This happens for any orders that do not have this field populated or if your site is not using the API. When this is the case, you will need to go to <b>Commerce</b> &gt; <b>Orders</b> &gt; <b>View</b> &gt; <b>Options</b> &gt; <b>Credit Order</b> and manually apply a detailed credit/refund.</p>
        <p>The <b>Credit Order</b> page defaults to the 'Detailed Credit' view and only shows those items that are being returned. This helps to reduce user error when an order is credited. See <a href="Use-the-view-order-window.htm">Using the View Order window</a> to learn more about crediting orders .</p>
