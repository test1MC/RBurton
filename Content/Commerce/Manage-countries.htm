                <p>You can allow shipping to countries where you may not normally sell your products. For example, a customer in the US can order and pay for an item that will ship to a country that you don't allow payment from. This can help you to increase your customer base.​ Mark the countries for which you want to disallow shipping, if applicable. Mark the countries for which you want to disallow billing, if applicable.</p>

                <p>You can select countries where shipping is not allowed through PayPal. By default, shipping is allowed to all countries when a customer selects PayPal as a payment method.</p>
                <p>If disallowed, when a customer in a country where shipping is disallowed, they will not be able to complete the checkout process. To determine the customer's country, they must go through the PayPal interface. When they are returned, <MadCap:variable name="DC.EOM short" />compares the customer's country against the disallowed list. If the country is not allowed:</p>
