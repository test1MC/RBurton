        <h1>Configuring the Amazon channel</h1>
        <p>Use this page to see Amazon channel transaction data to help configure marketing settings for it.</p>
        <h2>To see Amazon channel transaction data</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>From <b>Commerce</b> &gt; <b>Channels</b> &gt; <b>Amazon</b>, use the <b>Transmission History</b> to view an archive of transactions through Amazon.com for the last 10 days. The information will be deleted once it is 10 days old or older so this will need to be examined regularly to see if any errors have occurred that need to be addressed. For more in depth information on how to setup your Amazon Integration, check the Training Video Archive under the Support tab of the Site Manager to see a video dedicated specifically to Amazon Integration.</li>
            <li>Select a <b>Date From</b> and <b>Date Thru</b> range, keeping in mind that there is no information stored prior to the last 10 days.</li>
            <li>Select from the drop-down menu what information you would like the report to include (Order Acknowledged, File Feed Sent, and so on), or select <b>All Amazon Messages</b> for a comprehensive report.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Search</b>. If you selected All Amazon Messages, a complete archive of all transactions will appear, whether it’s your orders coming in or your product feeds going out. The information listed includes:<ol><li>Document number</li><li>Date</li><li>Type (file)</li><li>Status</li><li>Messages (Number of)</li><li>Successes (Number of)</li><li>Errors (Number of)</li><li><p>Warnings</p></li></ol><p><img src="images/Amazon1.png" style="mc-thumbnail: hover;mc-thumbnail-max-width: 560px;" /></p></li>
            <li>
                <p>If you see an Error, you can click the magnifying glass to view the specific reasons for that error.</p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you’re a current Amazon Seller Central customer, and you’re just beginning to use the Aptos platform, you have the option of Importing the Excel spreadsheets that you have been loading into Amazon on a daily basis into this area of the Site Manager.  This will automatically create all of your products as well as map all of your classifications and attributes according to the Amazon Item Classification guidelines. The Excel file Import can be found at the bottom of the screen where it says ICG Import.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Amazon ICG Import Sample can be found on the Support tab. Also, the Amazon sub-category must exist prior to importing. Importing these spreadsheets will automatically map to the existing sub-category.</div>
