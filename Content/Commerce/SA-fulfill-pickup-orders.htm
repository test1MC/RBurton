Begin by <a href="Fulfillment-for-Store-Associates.htm#Gaining_access_to_the_Order_Worklist">accessing the Order Worklist</a>; use the shortcut or link you were provided with. Orders are listed in order of oldest to newest, but you can toggle between listing oldest and newest first by clicking the <b>Elapsed Time</b> column header.</p>
                <p class="noteInDiv" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;Note: &#160;">Pick up orders are indicated by the text <b>Customer Pick Up</b> in the <b>Destination</b> column.</p>
                <p>Note that the worklist is dynamic, and is updated as new orders come in. You’ll see these new orders when you return to the Order Worklist, or refresh its screen. Expedited orders are shown in red.</p>
