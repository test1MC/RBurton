        <h1>Fulfillment for Store Associates<MadCap:concept term="Commerce" /></h1>
        <p>This section describes the order fulfillment process for store associates. It provides basic workflows used for orders shipping to customers, as well as for customer pick up orders. Special circumstances, for example partial pick ups, are also covered. First, here are a few basics.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>As a store associate, you’ll be given a browser shortcut or link which automatically logs you into Site Manager, and, brings you to your Order Worklist showing orders assigned to you and your store, ready for fulfilling.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>Be sure to bookmark this shortcut or link, and always use it to regain access to the Worklist, especially when the system automatically logs you out due to inactivity. If it does log you out, it may ask you to log back in. Rather than attempting to do that (using a login name and password), use the shortcut you were given.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>You won’t need to do any special filtering to show orders needing your attention. If you do, however, want to just see certain kinds of orders, for example new pickup orders because your fulfillment process prioritizes based on this, using the filters provided can help isolate just those. You can also filter by fulfillment status: <b>New</b>, <b>In Progress</b>, <b>Completed</b>, or <b>Ready for Pick Up</b>. You can also search for a specific order by its Order Number.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>Note that expedited orders appear in red in the <b>Order</b> column listing.</p>
                <p>When using filters, remember to click the <b>Refresh</b> button to reload the page with just the orders you want to see. Also remember to click <b>Clear Filters</b> when they’re no longer needed, to make sure you see all orders.</p>

                <p>While the Order Worklist works well with most browsers, we recommend using <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en-GB">Google Chrome</a>. If using Internet Explorer, make sure it’s version 11 or newer.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Exactly how you print a pick list, shipping label or other shipping documents depends on the browser you’re using, and your organization’s network. There is no specific method for printing these documents from the Order Worklist or other areas of Site Manager. Once you’ve generated and displayed a document you want to print, use your browser’s print feature to make the hardcopies you need.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The processes for fulfilling shipping and pickup orders differ slightly from one another, so they’re presented separately to avoid confusion. There is no actual need to deal with one or the other exclusively. You can certainly fulfill both types in parallel; just be aware which orders fall into either category. Note that pickup orders display the text 'Customer Pickup' in the destination column to avoid confusion between the two.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>System configurable parameters now support displaying the length of time an order has been active in the Order Worklist, rather than the date it was placed. For the most part, procedures presented here assume that elapsed time is the mode being used.</p>
