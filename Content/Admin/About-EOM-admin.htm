        <h4>Verify information is correctly processed</h4>
        <p>Monitor the movement of data to make sure correct values are stored in <MadCap:popup><MadCap:popupHead>Infobase</MadCap:popupHead><MadCap:popupBody>Infobase, the Aptos transactional database, is a collection of tables that stores the results of merchandising transactions.</MadCap:popupBody></MadCap:popup> tables.</p>
        <h4>Coordinate system processes with physical inventory</h4>
        <p>Run tasks before, during, and after counting physical inventory, to post inventory counts and ensure shrink is calculated correctly.</p>
        <h4>Maintain entities and data tables</h4>
        <p>Employees, locations and vendors are the data records most likely to require regular maintenance, along with tables that are referenced by data records. You can run periodic tasks for styles.</p>
        <h4>Maintain store databases by updating PLU files</h4>
        <p>Run an update when changes affect your location hierarchy, merchandise hierarchy, or prices. You can run updates for one, some, or all store databases, depending on the changes.</p>
        <h4>Define, run and monitor processes</h4>
        <p>Most Merchandising processes, including data import and export, exchange data among applications, statistical tracking, and volume reporting, are scheduled and run with the Pipeline tool. Some scheduled jobs in POM and A&amp;R require you to use the Foundation Server Monitor to create jobs, set up schedules for them, and ensure that they run correctly.</p>
        <h4>Modify parameters</h4>
        <p>Have the flexibility to change your system parameter settings to handle changing business circumstances. This is generally done in consultation with Aptos.</p>
