        <h1>Creating Scheduled reports<MadCap:concept term="analy" /></h1>
        <p>Clients can request basic reports to be emailed to them at specific times of the day. Once this report is selected, you can select the time for the report to run, a list of recipients, and create a custom email subject.</p>
        <p>You can schedule three kinds of reports:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Inventory Below Threshold</b> - Informs the recipient when items marked as such fall below inventory thresholds configured in the system.</li>
            <li><b>Quick Daily Transactions</b> - Emails the order totals on a daily basis for the current day and the previous 10 days.</li>
            <li><b>Subscription Stock</b> - Alerts the recipient when available inventory for subscription items fall below a pre-configured threshold.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
