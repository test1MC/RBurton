        <h1>Creating Inventory Sell Through reports<MadCap:concept term="analy" /></h1>
        <p>Sell through provides a composite measure of sales and inventory, and helps evaluate item performance. You typically evaluate sell through daily for fast moving products or weekly for slower moving or replenishment based products. A higher value is better, indicating your sales velocity is good and your inventory is appropriately forecast. Low sell through indicates either poor sales, or too much inventory. In most cases, sell through for an item is compared in recent periods like current week and last week, as well as in aggregate for several months or even a year.</p>
        <p>When evaluating sell through, you can use this reporting tool to sort by a period of time, a brand, a sub-category, or even a specific product or product option.</p>
