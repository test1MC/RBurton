        <h1>About user reports<MadCap:concept term="analy" /></h1>
        <p>Use user reports to view the progress of your sales representatives in a detailed or at-a-glance format with the commission report. You can use the credit/refund report to view a breakdown of credits and refunds. Additionally, you can create a PCI audit use report and an upsell/cross-sell report.</p>
        <p>Use scheduled reports to request basic reports to be emailed at specific times of the day. Keep track of your Site Manager users through the usage report. This report will show any settings or price changes that users have made in the Site Manager, as well as provide an audit trail to their page visits.</p>
