        <h1>Creating Historical Affiliate Tracking reports<MadCap:concept term="analy" /></h1>
        <p>Use this report to see how many marketing channels customers accessed before they place an order. If a customer touches an email, a search, or affiliates all within minutes of ordering, these various channels all get credit for the order. Aptos Digital Commerce tracks a customer in a 'multi-touch' manner. If a customer comes to your site from a specific affiliate source, and that source changes along the way multiple times, all this information is captured. This provides better tracking information than one which only includes the last touch a customer has with an affiliate. If a customer searches using the in-site search, Digital Commerce also captures that information.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="DC.EOM short" /> also captures different milestones, such as when an initially anonymous customer identifies themselves by logging in, or by creating a customer account. It also captures other milestones, such as when a customer places an order, and when the affiliate switch and in-site search take place.</p>
