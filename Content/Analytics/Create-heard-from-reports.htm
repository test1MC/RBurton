        <h1>Creating Heard From reports<MadCap:concept term="analy" /></h1>
        <p>This report helps you to understand how your customers are finding your website.</p>
        <p><span class="note">Note:</span> Aptos recommends making the <b>Heard From</b> section of your check-out process optional. If you make <b>Heard From</b>mandatory, many customers will check off the first option they see in order to speed through checkout, and this can lead to inaccurate metrics.</p>
        <p>Data is displayed in a 3D pie chart showing a percentage breakdown of your customers “heard from” selections. A data table beside the chart shows the “heard from” medium (<MadCap:popup><MadCap:popupHead>magazine, newsletter, and so on</MadCap:popupHead><MadCap:popupBody>You can change these settings in CRM &gt; Communications &gt; Listings.</MadCap:popupBody></MadCap:popup>), the corresponding number of people who came from each source, and the total dollar amount spent by those customers.</p>
