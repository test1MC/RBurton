        <h1>Creating Cost Trend Analysis reports<MadCap:concept term="analy" /></h1>
        <p>Use the Cost Trend Analysis report to generate charts that display the product and shipping costs. The report shows each product and each option as a separate chart.  Use this report to measure costs associated with particular suppliers. You can break down the report by sub-category or brand, or supplier.</p>
        <p>The chart generated highlights the costs/shipping costs per PO. Red represents the product cost plus the shipping cost. Blue represents the product cost. The dates displayed for the data represent the date that the PO was sent.</p>
