        <p>Use the Cart Conversion report to identify and monitor abandoned carts. You can then send an email to the visitors who left your site with items still in their carts, and offer them an incentive for returning and purchasing those items.</p>

        <p>The report displays a bar graph showing summary data on Site Visitors, Real People, Abandoned Carts, Orders, and Shopping Carts. In addition, a table showing shopping cart conversion performance is displayed.</p>
