        <h1>Creating Credit/Refund reports<MadCap:concept term="analy" /></h1>
        <p>Use this report to view a breakdown of credits and refunds including the reason for the credit/refund, total credit amount per date, and total credit amount per state over the specified date range.</p>
        <p>The report includes a pie chart and three data tables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a pie chart and associated first data table breaks down the credits/refunds based on reason (for example, exchange, could not ship, buyer canceled, and so on).</li>
            <li>the middle data table displays credit totals and credit amounts based on specific dates.</li>
            <li>the bottom data table shows credit totals and amounts broken down by US States.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
