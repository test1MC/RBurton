        <h1>Creating Enhanced reports<MadCap:concept term="analy" /></h1>
        <p>Aptos’s optional enhanced reporting services provides unparalleled access to mission critical data. This tool provides better access to generate reports based on the data you deem important and critical to your business needs and processes.</p>
        <p>Business owners and decision makers rely on reports to run their operations for an array of reasons — to make better decisions, to increase efficiencies, to service customers more effectively and to respond more quickly to opportunities.</p>
        <p>Enhanced reporting enables you to access your databases directly and quickly transform raw data into useful and readily understood information. With Enhanced Reporting you can extract the information you need from one or more related tables and format it into tables, reports, or charts. You can view the resulting report in your Web-browser and then print it. You can also export reports in several formats, including Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Adobe PDF.</p>
        <p>For example, if you want a list of outstanding sales orders for each customer and you know that your database has a table called Customers, and another table called Orders, they can be linked together using the common field called CustomerID. Using Reports, you can “join” the two tables and then choose the data fields you need, such as customer name, phone number, order number, order date, and order amount. You can use a filter to select only open orders and you can sort the data by customer. Finally you can view or print the report, create the report as a PDF file, or output it to Excel.</p>
