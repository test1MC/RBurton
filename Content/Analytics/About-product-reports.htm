                <p>Product Reports contain information generated in Digital Commerce related to your products.</p>
            </div>
            <p>You can customize product reports. For example, you can create an inventory velocity report which provides information on the recent sales of each SKU as well as an estimate of how long the existing quantity will last. The most viewed report allows you to analyze your most viewed products. Use the productivity report to view a list of your most popular items as well as provides a breakdown of order totals and shipping for those items. You can pull reports on products by Sub-Category and use the profit margin report to measure the profit, and not just base revenue, for your sales over a specified time period. Analyze your shipping costs, view top categories, and more.</p>
