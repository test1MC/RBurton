        <h1>Creating Transaction History reports<MadCap:concept term="analy" /></h1>
        <p>Use this report to reconcile your order transactions against the transaction history information provided by the payment processor. This allows you to verify that you have been paid on each transaction. If a transaction has been voided and/or credited, these orders are displayed, and are associated with a negative dollar amount. You can also use the report to <a href="#Settling">settle or synchronize Authorize.net orders</a>.</p>
