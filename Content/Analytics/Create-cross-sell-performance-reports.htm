        <h1>Create Cross-sell Performance reports<MadCap:concept term="analy" /></h1>
        <p> This report shows which products consumers bought with other products, and can help you to build or improve post-checkout workflow.</p>
        <p>You can select from two different sets of cross-sell information between a specified date range.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>By Revenue</b> results show how much revenue was generated when products were bought together (in the same cart).</li>
            <li><b>By Views</b> results show how many times a product was viewed by a customer when considering another product.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Three sets of information are displayed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a pie chart indicating either the number of times a product was bought with another, or the number of times a product was viewed with another.</li>
            <li>a color-coded legend to the pie chart indicating which two products are being paired.</li>
            <li>a table providing additional details about the cross-sell conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use this information to build out a post-checkout workflow based on consumer behavior, or tweak an existing one to improve conversion during post-checkout.</p>
