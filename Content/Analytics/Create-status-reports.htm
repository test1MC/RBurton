        <p>The Order Status report provides a breakdown of the state of your orders over a specific date range. Use it to keep track of orders' statuses in the completion process, and analyze any inconsistencies or spikes in returns, back-orders, or incomplete orders. Then, see if a change to your ordering process improves the status report results over time.</p>
        <p>A pie chart shows item breakdown by status, as well as a table showing this information along with counts.</p>
