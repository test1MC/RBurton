        <h1>Creating New Buyers reports<MadCap:concept term="analy" /></h1>
        <p>The New Buyers report searches for buyer activity within the time period you specify. The report shows only those buyers that have not purchased before, and are not declined or have canceled purchases.</p>
        <p>The report can be filtered by state, and by Tier Group. This is reflected at the order level, the affiliate and customer tiers that were assigned to the customer at the time of the order.</p>
