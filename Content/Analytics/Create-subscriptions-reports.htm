        <h1>Creating Subscriptions reports<MadCap:concept term="analy" /></h1>
        <p>Use this report to check on subscription trends and plan your free trials accordingly. You can search for subscriptions by their Requested Date, Scheduled Date and Completed Date.</p>
        <p>The report displays:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Days—refers to the number of days from the day the order was placed. This way, if you have, for example, a 30-day money back guarantee, you can see whether the number of days falls within the allotted time frame. If the order is canceled, “days” signifies the number of days from when the order was placed until it was canceled.</li>
            <li>Card Processed—relates to the number of attempts that were made to charge the card.</li>
        </ul>
