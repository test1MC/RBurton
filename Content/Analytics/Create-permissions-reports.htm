        <h1>Creating Permissions reports<MadCap:concept term="analy" /></h1>
        <p>Use this report to see permissions for all Site Manager users. This report provides a high level overview of all user permissions set in your Site Manager, and gives a general idea of the level of access given to each user.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">This report is useful when using Enhanced Roles and Permissions (Version 2). While this permission capability is available on all websites, it must be set by our support group. It's important to have a plan to migrate to this version. With the new capabilities available to you, you'll want to make sure that your current users can continue to access the areas they need to. Please contact your Client Manager to discuss and plan for this enhancement if you decide to use it.</p>
        <p>The report shows user's name, the role group they belong to, if any, and their access level for each tab in the Site Manager. If any value is blank, it means that the permissions in that section are set up at a lower level, and the Users tab can be used to drill down to view this individual user's permissions.</p>
