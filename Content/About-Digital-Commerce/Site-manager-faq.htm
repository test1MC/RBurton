        <p>Through continuous innovation and rapid software release cycles, we’re able to share unique, cutting-edge developments and features for the Aptos platform across our entire client base. As a result, our clients can establish their ecommerce brands and drive sales through best-in-class online retail sites. Certain updates require that your system be programmed to accept add-ons. Our in-house IT staff will install those options as needed.</p>
        <p>These are a few key points to remember when using the site manager:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the browser back button to undo an action once it’s been completed. Or, return to the Dashboard, click on the tab you’re currently operating in, and click on the link again to start fresh.</li>
            <li>When user information is disabled, it is deleted from the system. It must be re-entered if you want to have this information recorded in the system.</li>
            <li>Always click the <b>Save</b> button where available to retain your entry.</li>
            <li>The system administrator controls the level of permission granted a user; not all users have the same access to data or system functions.</li>
            <li>Confidential information entered into site manager remains private and can be accessed only at the discretion of the system administrator.</li>
            <li>You can remove an entry by clicking the <b>Delete</b> link found next to table listings.</li>
            <li>We recommend you use the Staging site manager versus the Production site manager for testing. This will allow you to test various options on your staging site before exposing your updates and changes to the live production site.</li>
        </ul>
