        <p>Searching for products</p>
        <p>The Search/Group/Apply functionality allows users to do the following: Search for a wide range of product, Group them, and then Apply them to a new or existing Sub-Category.</p>
        <p>As an example, suppose that you would like to create a new Sub-Category for items of a certain color. You will have to search for products with your desired color attribute, e.g. black. Use the fields described below to create a new Sub-Category. Enter your search criteria into the Search By parameters.</p>
        <p>•Field - You can search by pre-populated fields such as: Sub-Category, Brand, Name (SKU or UPC), Option Name (SKU or UPC), or classification/attribute. In addition, you can Add Search Conditions as needed.</p>
        <p>•Operation - Choose an operation from the drop-down menu.</p>
        <p>•Compare To - Enter the parameters that you want to filter for.</p>
        <p>•And/Or - If needed, enter and/or parameters.</p>
        <p>•Search - Click on the Search button to filter for the choices selected.</p>
        <p>For example as illustrated below, to search for products with the desired color attribute of black, you would use the "Option, Name, SKU or UPC" parameter in the Field section, "Contains" in the Operation field and "color=black" in the Compare To field.</p>
