        <p>Use the Brands section to enter product branding information in the site manager. A product identity, or brand image, is typically the attributes one associates with a brand, how the brand owner wants the customer to perceive the brand; and by extension the branded company, organization, product or service.</p>
        <p>Because of the importance customers associate with a brand or manufacturer, take special care in the set up and meta content associated with your brands. The brands pages in the site manager give you various options in handling brand information on your site.</p>
        <p>You may also choose to hide the brand or manufacturer name if your business needs call for that option.</p>
        <p>You can set up and manage your brands and brand meta content in the <b>Add/Edit</b> window. Aptos also has a brands spreadsheet in which you can manage the content.</p>
