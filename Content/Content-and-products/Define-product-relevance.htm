        <h1>Defining product relevance<MadCap:concept term="CP" /></h1>
        <p>Use product relevance to define the order in which your products will appear within each Sub-Category. The product relevance functionality allows you to easily define this order, and to update product names if needed. If no display order is defined, your products are displayed alphabetically.</p>
        <p><span class="note">Note:</span> Your site must be wired to accommodate sub-category display order. If you wish to define this order, contact your Client Manager to discuss further.</p>
        <p>There are two ways to define product relevance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>using the <b>Standard View</b>, where you drag and drop products to define order of relevance,</li>
            <li>
                <p>using the <b>Extended View</b>, where you manually rank relevance order by number. Extended view displays more product information, which you can edit as well.</p>

                <p>When a product name changes, <MadCap:popup><MadCap:popupHead>301 redirects</MadCap:popupHead><MadCap:popupBody>A  method of telling web browsers and search engines that a web page or site has been permanently moved to a new location.

By creating 301 redirects, <MadCap:variable name="DC.EOM short"></MadCap:variable> ensures that when you change the display name of a product, any potential customers who have bookmarked "liked" or stored the page will automatically be transferred to the new product page. This reduces <MadCap:popup><MadCap:popupHead>404 errors</MadCap:popupHead><MadCap:popupBody>Page Not Found errors</MadCap:popupBody></MadCap:popup> that could lead to lost sales.</p>
                <p>After changing and saving product display name changes, the Create 301 Redirect pop-up window opens. It notes that the system has created a new page with a new URL for each changed product. Select the products for which you want <MadCap:variable name="DC.EOM short" /> to create 301 redirects. After making all the relevant changes, click <b>Save</b> located at the button of the page.</p>
