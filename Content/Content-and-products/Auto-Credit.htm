        <h1>Auto Credit task<MadCap:concept term="CP" /></h1>
        <p>The Auto Credit task is used to automatically issue a credit for orders with eligible returned items.</p>
        <div class="note">Contact your Account Manager or Client Care if you would like to configure and use this job scheduler task.</div>
        <h2>Eligible orders</h2>
        <p>Orders must meet all of these conditions for the Auto Credit task to perform:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only orders paid in full with a credit card or paid in full with PayPal are eligible.</li>
            <li>Only items with a Return Location indicated for the supplier ID that is holding the returned item.</li>
            <li>Only items with a Returned Received status (Item Status ID = 24).</li>
            <li>Only items with a valid value in Item Return Date.</li>
            <li>Only items where the amount to be refunded is greater than zero.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Exclusions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>No mixed tender scenarios.</li>
            <li>If an attempt to automatically credit an item fails it will be set to Status ID = 47 and the item will no longer be eligible for the automatic crediting process.</li>
            <li>Orders that have had previous credits created via the site manager or through an API are excluded because the previous tax credit on an item cannot be tracked.</li>
            <li>Multiple capture scenarios are excluded as it is not possible to select the correct capture instance for crediting purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The credit is requested from the credit card processor or PayPal. In a successful credit, the system will perform the following actions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Record and display the credit information in the Payment Information section of the Process Payment and View Order tabs of the order.</li>
            <li>Record and display the item credit and tax such that the net difference is zero (0) in the Credit Order tab. It will display the portion of the tax that is credited.</li>
            <li>An Order Note will be added indicating that the credit was done using the automated process and will display the Part No or Option Value, the quantity returned and the amount credited.<ul><li>The amount credited is calculated as: Item total + item - item discount(s) - coupon discount(s). If shipping tax is attached to the item, it is also credited.</li></ul></li>
            <li>
                <p>The item will no longer appear in the Return without Credit Report (Analytics &gt; Order Reports &gt; Returns without Credit).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>On a failed credit, <MadCap:variable name="DC.EOM short" /> will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add an Order Note indicating an automated credit process failed along with reasons passed through from the processor.</li>
            <li>The item status will be set to Auto Credit Failure (ID 47).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When an order credit is generated by the Auto Credit task job, the system will do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If available, it will generate an affiliate level Order Credit email.</li>
            <li>If an affiliate level Order Credit email template is not available, it will generate a site level Order Credit email.</li>
        </ul>
