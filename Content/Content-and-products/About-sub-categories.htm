        <h1>About sub-categories<MadCap:concept term="CP" /></h1>
        <p>In a brick and mortar store, if categories are the aisle headers (for example  Frozen Foods), sub-categories help the customer locate products they want in a quick and an efficient manner by defining from a slightly lower level what they will find in the aisle (Frozen Dinners, Ice Cream, and so on).</p>
        <p>Set up sub-categories in their related categories to help your customers locate products they want. You can also assign featured content, define and assign comparable specifications, create cross-sell/up-sell groups, and define product order within each sub-category.</p>
        <p>Use the Sub-Categories section to manage:</p>
